`api.py` is the API which queries from the database.

To access it locally:
1. Run `python3 api.py` with the password to the RDS as the first command line argument
2. Navigate to `localhost:2000` on your browser.

If you are running it for the first time:
1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install Python modules. You may do this in a Python virtual environment if you wish.
