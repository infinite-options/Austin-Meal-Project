                On Sundays and Mondays (you can pick your preferred time) we
                deliver to work, gym or home to try to ensure someone can
                quickly place the food in the fridge. Make sure to email us at
                info@preptoyourdoor.com if you have special instructions. Many
                times, we will go into the home and stock the fridge for
                customers who cannot be home, but that is up to you and your
                comfort level.
                <br />
                <br />
                We deliver in a thermal bag that will keep cold to 30-90 minutes
                depending on the outside temperature. We leave the delivery on
                the porch, unless otherwise specified. While the contents of our
                food is all dairy and meat free, the time lapse could effect the
                lifespan of the meals. The sooner you can place in the fridge,
                the better :)
                <br />
                <br />
                If the delivery days are not conducive with your schedule, email
                us! If we have enough people requesting a different day, we can
                make adjustments as needed!
