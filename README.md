# Prep-To-Your-Door

This repository contains the entire codebase for the revamped Prep To Your Door, a vegan meal ordering app. You can access the live website [here.](https://www.preptoyourdoor.com/)

### client/
This is where the frontend lies. It is done in React, and can be run within the directory with the command `npm run`. Be sure to `npm install` all Node dependencies.

Once Node is running the app, you can access it on your browser at `localhost:3000`.

### backend/
This is where all the server-side stuff is. You'll find code for APIs, database schemas, and other backend code not included in the React app.
